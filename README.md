# Goals, Problem, & Motivation
The goal of this project is to implement an autocomplete algorithm using a large database of English words and two different data structures, tries and B+ trees. This conceptual project will have a command-line interface for demonstrating autocompletion to the whole word nearest to a typed entry and further word option selection. Once implemented, we aim to calculate and compare the asymptotic complexities of each implementation, allowing us to ascertain which implementation is superior. Alas, we will have an autocomplete algorithm that efficiently improves typing speed and reduces typos, thereby improving productivity and efficacy of communication.

## Features
TBD

## Dataset
<p> Our data will be derived from the A-Z text files of English words from this GitHub repository: <br>
https://github.com/kloge/The-English-Open-Word-List/tree/master/EOWL%20LF%20Delimited%20Format

## Trie Complexity
TBD

## B+ Tree Complexity
TBD

## Testing Instructions
If testing B+ Tree implementation in CLion, keep the .cpp and .h files in the project folder. Then, place the data folder containing all of the "_ Words.txt" files in the cmake-build-debug folder.
Then,...
